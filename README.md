🎓 Student Certificate Verification using Blockchain
📜 About
This project provides a decentralized solution for student certificate verification using Blockchain technology.
It ensures certificates are authentic, tamper-proof, and easily verifiable without relying on centralized authorities.

🚀 Technologies Used
Solidity — Smart contract programming

Truffle — Smart contract development framework

Ganache — Personal Ethereum blockchain for testing

Node.js (optional, for running scripts/UI)

🛠️ Setup Instructions
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Blockchain.git
cd Blockchain
Install Truffle and Ganache

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g truffle
# Install Ganache from: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
Start Ganache

Open Ganache GUI or use CLI (ganache-cli)

Make sure it's running at http://127.0.0.1:7545

Compile the Smart Contracts

bash
Copy
Edit
truffle compile
Deploy the Contracts

bash
Copy
Edit
truffle migrate
(Optional) Run Tests

bash
Copy
Edit
truffle test
📄 Smart Contracts Included
Certificate.sol

University.sol

Verifier.sol

Student.sol

(Each contract plays a role in managing certificates, universities, verifiers, and student data.)

📢 Notes
Make sure Ganache is running before deploying contracts.

Contracts are deployed on a local blockchain (Ganache) but can be easily migrated to testnets like Rinkeby or Goerli.

Future improvements could include adding a React.js frontend for easier certificate verification by users.
